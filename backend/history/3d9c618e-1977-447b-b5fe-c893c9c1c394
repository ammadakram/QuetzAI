Human: How does Spanner solve snapshot isolation?
AI: Spanner solves snapshot isolation by using the concept of timestamping for every interaction. For read-write transactions, the timestamp is the commit time, and for read-only transactions, the timestamp is the start time. Read-only transactions will only use the record with the largest timestamp less than its own timestamp, ensuring a serializable order.
